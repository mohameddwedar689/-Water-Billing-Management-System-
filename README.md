##  Motivation

The Following are the objectives of this project:

- Master Working with **Windows Form App**
- Master Working with **Database**
- Working using the Parallel-model Methodology to plan and develop the software
- Learn How to work together as a team 
- Learn the process of the following a given set of System Requirements to develop a software

## Brief

In this brief we will explain how the online water  billing system works.

**The first step** for the customer is to enter his  information. His full name, mail, national id number,  water meter number, address and his online payment  number (which is written on his water bill receipt). By the end of this step the customer will have an  account so he can be able to log in and out easily  whenever he uses the application.

**The second step** for the customer is to request to  know how much his bill is. Which is an easy thing to  do in the application Then he will also be able to pay it online by using his  credit card (no matter which bank does it belong to).  And if the customer faces any type of problems or  questions. He can directly report to the feedback and  support, then we will be able to help him by  identifying the problem and solving it.

This project is fully implemented using the C# and MySQL

- C# (pronounced "See Sharp") is a modern, object-oriented, and type-safe programming language. C# enables developers to build many types of secure and robust applications that run in .NET. C# has its roots in the C family of languages and will be immediately familiar to C, C++, Java, and JavaScript programmers. This tour provides an overview of the major components of the language in C# 8 and earlier
- MySQL is an open-source relational database management system. As with other relational databases, MySQL stores data in tables made up of rows and columns. Users can define, manipulate, control, and query data using Structured Query Language, more commonly known as SQL

## Coding Style

This project is divided into two main parts, frontend and backend,  Our backend is divide into routes that act as a middle point between the client and the database.
